  <h1><code>Flipper Zero: Secret Shutdown scripts</code></h1>
  <p>
    This repository contains scripts created to work with the BadUSB/BadKB functions in Flipper Zero.  They are compatible with any device that supports Ducky Script. When you run one of these scripts, PowerShell quickly appears and a command is issued to turn off the computer after a set time. You choose this time yourself, for example: if you run a script named: 1 minute, the computer will shut down after 1 minute without any notification to the user. Please remember that this script is intended solely for educational purposes!
